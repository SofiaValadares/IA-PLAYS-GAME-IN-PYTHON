"""
This file contains the definition of different boards and their corresponding goals.
Each board is represented by a dictionary of photons, where the keys are the photon IDs and the values are instances of the Photon class.
The Photon class represents a photon with its color and connected photon IDs.

Example:
    photons_empty = {
        1: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [16, 10, 11]),
        2: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [11, 17, 12]),
        ...
    }

    board1 = Board(photons={
        1: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [16, 10, 11]),
        2: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [11, 17, 12]),
        ...
    })

    goal1 = Board(photons={
        1: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [16, 10, 11]),
        2: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [11, 17, 12]),
        ...
    })

    ...

The Board class represents a board with its photons. It has a constructor that takes a dictionary of photons as input.

Example:
    board1 = Board(photons={
        1: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [16, 10, 11]),
        2: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [11, 17, 12]),
        ...
    })

    goal1 = Board(photons={
        1: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [16, 10, 11]),
        2: Photon(0, [0, 0, 0], [11, 17, 12]),
        ...
    })
